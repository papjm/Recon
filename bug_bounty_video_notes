Try to check your custom directories that carries the name of the subdomain e.g : https://subdomain.example.com/subdomain(windows NTLM)
you will need NTLM challenge decoder(burp extension)
in situations where the server uses HTTP/2 downgrade to http/1.1


shodan download --limit 100000 chip 'hostname: "domain.com"'
you may need to initialize your api-key if you haven't done that before.
to add your api key run : shodan init <api key>

shodan download --limit 100000 j 'ssl: "organization for all inc"'

cat ips.txt | httpx --random-agent --status-code --title -server -td -cl -fc 400

leveraging shodan:
HOW TO DORK ON SHODAN:
ssl: "organissation name"
Ssl.cert.subject.CN:"orwa.com"

use domain collector to fetch subdomains from crt.sh
also check out subdomainer

gitter (for checking company chats)    https://gitter.im/
and also check stack overflow for endpoints
when dorking github search for security_credentials and LDAP protocol

get ip ranges from asn with this oneliner(install the toolsl where necessary).
echo AS394161 | asnmap -silent | naabu -silent
echo AS394161 | asnmap -silent | naabu -silent -nmap-cli 'nmap -sV'
use smap to do port scannning (built in with shodan)...smap by s0md3v
smaller companies may not own their asn or ips so look at the cloud for all their assests:
CLOUD RECON:
cloud recon uses SSL certificate enumeration to find subdomains of our targets
check out g0ldencybersec github repor for cloudrecon:
crt.sh and browsers also offer this services
onliner for cloud recon:
cloudrecon scrape -i
find the git repo that has all ip ranges for services on the cloud, save it to a txt file and grep or download from kaeferjaeger.gay
for "domain.com"
use this bash script to output the file in a useable format:
grep -F '.domain.com' file.txt | awk -F '[][]' '{print $2}' | sed 's# #\n#g' | grep ".domain.com" | sort -fu| cut -d ',' -f1 | sort -u


or run this one liner to give all subdomains and domains related(via ssl certificate) to domain.com
grep -F '.domain.com' file.txt | awk -F '[][]' '{print $2}' | sed 's# #\n#g' | sort -fu| cut -d ',' -f1 | sort -u
